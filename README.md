Instructions

I'mma leave it as simple as I can.

Guys it's important you read the post's caption on the respective platform wether it's Insta or TikTok. 
The caption provides information that will help you navigate the repository to help you find the snippet that you are looking for.

Usual caption format is as follows:

    ‚ú® Repo: scode ‚ú®
    ‚ú® Folder: cards/card-1 ‚ú®

    The completed code can be found on GitHub within the 'reels-tiktok/layouts/d1' repo.

    If you find what I share useful, tap the ‚ô•Ô∏è icon and follow me on social platforms. I'd really appreciate it. 
    And, if you have any feedback or questions, let me know in the comments üí¨. Thank you! No-bugs coding!

I hope everything is simple enough for you to navigate.
